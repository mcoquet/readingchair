A cli UI to interact with any pouchdb compatible database. 

This means any remote or local couchdb instance, and file based storage, even memory store if thats you'r thing.

Uses blessed.

# What we wish to accomplish: 

[Couchdb](http://couchdb.com) and [Pouchdb](http://pouchdb.com) are awesome. 

Often though, access to a remote couchdb instance is sitting behind some draconian firewall rules, or the web interface is just hidden. Maybe you just want to inspect some local pouchdb instance and you'd stuck with writing some scripts to dump your stuff to a file.

We wish to make this easier from the command line.
